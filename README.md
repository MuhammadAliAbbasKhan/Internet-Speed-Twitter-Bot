# Internet-Speed-Twitter-Bot
This project automates the process of checking internet speed using Speedtest.net and tweets your internet service provider (ISP) if the speed is below the promised rate. Built with Python and Selenium, this bot makes it easy to hold your ISP accountable for delivering slow speeds.
